# Poker Hand Evaluator

This repository contains a console-based application that deals and evaluates poker hands for a simplified version of the five-card draw variant. It meets the requirements of an assessment task.

## Overview

Five-card draw is a variant of poker where each player receives a hand of 5 cards, is then allowed to swap any number of those cards for new ones, and then competes against each other based on the standard 5 card poker hand strength.

This application simulates the dealing and evaluation of poker hands. It shuffles a standard deck of 52 cards, deals a single hand of 5 cards to the player, and evaluates the player's hand, informing them of the highest ranked poker hand that matches their hand of 5 cards.

## Poker Hand Rankings

The standard 5 card poker hand strengths are used for evaluation:

1. Straight Flush
2. Four of a Kind
3. Full House
4. Flush
5. Straight
6. Three of a Kind
7. Two Pair
8. One Pair
9. High Card
